name: 'Dispatch'

description: |
  This action can be used to send a generic repository_dispatch event to a
  repo. This is useful when you want to send info from one repository to
  another through an action. For example, we use this action to notify
  language-family repos when their implementation dependencies get updates.

    description: 'Repository that should receive the dispatch event'
